# About this script:
# -----------------
# This script prepares a user environment to build spinnaker from source.
# It is intended to only be run one time. Typically on a newly provisioned
# GCE instance, but could be run on any linux machine.
#
# What it does:
# ------------
# This script will do the following:
#
#   * Create a $HOME/.git-credentials file if one does not already exist
#       You will be prompted for your github username and two-factor access
#       token.
#
#   * Creates a build/ directory as a subdirectory of $PWD.
#
#   * Clone each of the spinnaker subsystem github repositories into build/
#
#       When a repository is cloned, an upstream remote will be added to
#       reference the authoritative repository for the given repository.
#       (e.g. the spinnaker github repository corresponding to your origin).
#
#       If the environment variable GIHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER is set then
#       the repositories will be cloned from that github user. Otherwise it
#       will be cloned from the user in your .git-credentials. If the owner
#       is "upstream" then it will clone the authoritative repository for each
#       repository cloned (e.g. all the 'spinnaker' repositories).
#
#    * Print out next step instructions.
#
#
# Running the script:
# -------------------
# Rather than executing the script, you can source it to leave some side
# effects in the current shell, such as path changes for new installed
# components.

When selecting a repository owner, you can use "upstream" to use
each of the authoritative repositories rather than your own forks.
However, you will not be able to push any changes "upstream".
This selection is only used if this script will be cloning repositories.
